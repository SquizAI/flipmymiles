# FlipMyMiles AI Optimization Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive plan for optimizing [FlipMyMiles](https://flipmymiles.com/) - a leading airline miles and points brokerage platform - through AI automation and unified agentic systems.

The project aims to revolutionize both the buying and selling processes for airline miles and points by implementing cutting-edge AI technologies, creating a more efficient, secure, and profitable ecosystem for all stakeholders.

## Business Model Analysis

FlipMyMiles operates as a mileage broker that:

1. **Connects sellers and buyers**: Acts as an intermediary between individuals/businesses with excess rewards points and travelers seeking premium flight bookings
2. **Provides competitive rates**: Offers higher payouts for points (up to 1-1.5 cents per point) compared to direct redemption through credit card programs
3. **Ensures secure transactions**: Utilizes technological solutions to secure customer information and maintain confidentiality
4. **Delivers immediate payment**: Processes payments quickly after points are transferred, typically via check or direct deposit
5. **Handles the entire process**: Manages all aspects of the transaction, reducing complexity for customers
